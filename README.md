# Meridian Collective
Shared GitHub Repository for the Meridian Collective Research Team.

Consists of five key directories:

**I.      Projects: Collection of projects and deliverables related to Meridian Collective Projects.**

  *Each project folder consists of an input, temporary, output, and code folder for reproducibility.*
  
**II.     Resources: Collection of web pages, online textbooks, Twitter links, YouTube videos, etc., which are specifically related to tips on how to program effectively in different programming languages (primarily: R, Python, STATA, Tableau, and ArcGIS). This could include PDF overviews of useful packages (in R or Python) or helpful Stack Exchange/STATA Forum posts (i.e. how to run a for loop, how to manipulate string variables, how to work with dates).**

**III.    Code Samples: Collection of scripts across programming languages**

   *A. Personal - Any scripts we have produced through work or independent research which are worth sharing amongst ourselves.*
   
   *B. Sourced - Any scripts we have found online (often available for reproducibility of journal publications) which serve as good examples for our efforts.*
    
**IV.     Output Samples: Collection of links to data platforms, PDFs of visuals, etc., which we find particuarly aesthetic or otherwise relevant.

**V.      Any miscellanous inputs relevant for our knowledge/understanding of quantitative data analysis.**
